<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transvenous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators</li><li>Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) market comprises two primary types: Transvenous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators and Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators. Transvenous ICDs involve leads that are threaded through veins to the heart, effectively monitoring and treating arrhythmias. In contrast, Subcutaneous ICDs are placed under the skin, eliminating the need for lead placement in the heart, thus reducing complications. Both types serve the critical function of detecting and correcting life-threatening heart rhythms, enhancing patient safety and quality of life.</p></p>
