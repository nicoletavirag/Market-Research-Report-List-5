<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiopulmonary Autotransfusion System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unwashed ATS</li><li>Washed ATS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiopulmonary autotransfusion system (ATS) market is divided into two primary types: unwashed ATS and washed ATS. Unwashed ATS devices collect and reinfuse patient blood without any pre-processing, retaining all components for immediate use. In contrast, washed ATS involves processing the collected blood to remove unwanted elements, such as debris and anticoagulants, enhancing the safety and quality of the reinfused blood. Each type serves specific clinical needs based on the patient's condition and surgical requirements.</p></p>
