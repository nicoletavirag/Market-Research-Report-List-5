<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebrospinal Fluid CSF Management Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CSF Shunts</li><li>CSF Drainage Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) management devices market primarily consists of two main types: CSF shunts and CSF drainage systems. CSF shunts are implantable devices that redirect excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain's ventricles to another area of the body, helping to manage conditions like hydrocephalus. In contrast, CSF drainage systems are used to temporarily remove fluid from the intracranial space for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, often utilized in acute medical settings to reduce intracranial pressure.</p></p>
