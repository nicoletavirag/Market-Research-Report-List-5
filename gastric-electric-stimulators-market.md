<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gastric Electric Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Frequency GES Devices</li><li>High Frequency GES Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gastric electric stimulators market comprises two main types: low frequency and high frequency devices. Low frequency GES devices typically deliver pulses at a slower rate, promoting gastric motility and alleviating symptoms of gastroparesis. Conversely, high frequency GES devices emit rapid electrical pulses, enhancing gastric emptying and reducing nausea more effectively. Both device types target digestive disorders, offering therapeutic options tailored to individual patient needs and preferences, ultimately improving quality of life for those with gastrointestinal conditions.</p></p>
