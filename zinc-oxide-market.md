<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zinc Oxide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Process (America Method)</li><li>Indirect Process (French Method)</li><li>Wet Chemical Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Zinc oxide is produced through three main processes: Direct Process (America Method), Indirect Process (French Method), and Wet Chemical Process. The Direct Process involves the oxidation of zinc vapor with oxygen, producing high-purity zinc oxide. The Indirect Process involves the formation of zinc sulfate solution, which is then purified and converted to zinc oxide. The Wet Chemical Process involves the reaction of zinc with an alkaline solution to form zincate, which is then precipitated as zinc oxide. Each method has its own advantages and applications in the market.</p></p>
